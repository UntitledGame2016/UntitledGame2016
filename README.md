"Prophecy's Chosen" Game Prototype 

My name is Howard Park and I am the main programmer for this game.

Some little things about me:
I am currently going to be a Junior in NYU's Tandon School of Engineering majoring in Integrated Digital Media 
and pursuing a minor in Game Engineering. I hope to combine the disciplines of both fields to develop an advanced knowledge
that can compete on an industrial scale and land a job in a quality company that harbors the same interests as me.

I started programming in SFML after some basic intensive study of C++ in my current undergraduate career in NYU.
Although I am a Integrated Digital Media major, a good portion of my career has been invested in learning to code, which I started
off doing with Python. I've tinkered with a little bit of PyGame when I first started out, but realized after taking 
Data Structures & Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming classes, C++ was optimal memory management and use of pointers
were a lot cleaner and efficient for coding a game. 

There's a lot here that I wish to discuss with others about my game as well as credit those that have given me a lot of direct 
and indirect support throughout the whole development process. I have a google document following this journey and I'll link it here
for those that are interested: https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/document/d/1aRhrJnNl2PzFLm7AUCJMhIKkYq5iOQSC7BP-C4mQcNo/edit?usp=sharing

Thank you for your time if you got to read this far and I hope you got to know a little about me.
